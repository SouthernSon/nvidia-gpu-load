# nvidia-gpu-load
Short script for parsing and displaying GPU usage from nvidia-settings.
Use when nvidia-smi fails to show relevent info for consumer-level cards.

Requires nividia-settings. Written for bash.

Should work for multiple gpus, but untested.

Use "watch -n X" to monitor output.

Loosely based on a script found floating around on the Nvidia Dev forums, cleaned
it up and made it usuable.
